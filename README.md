# BYU Course/Major API

Interested in running analytics or making web services to help people schedule classes/find their dream major/find out what minors they can get?  Let this API do the heavy lifting for you.

## Accessible & Free to Use
Anyone can query the server for course or major information.

## Up-to-date
Course/major data is updated nightly from BYU's database.

## In Progress - Contributors welcome!
What works

* Data retrieval, formatting and storage

What doesn't work

* Paths to query data
* Performance optimizations (don't ask too much of the server please)

Happy to have contributors - BYU students preferred (for ease of collaboration) but anyone else interested is welcome to ask.

If you make something cool using this, please let me know!
